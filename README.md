# dtfm (define this for me)
Small and simple reddit bot that replies the definition of a word when 
summoned in the comments. The bot uses the [Oxford Dictionaries API](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/documentation#/)
to retrieve the word's definition. In order for the bot to reply with a definition, the 
word to be defined must be preceded by **dtfm+**.
